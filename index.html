                                       Continued...When I moved down to North Carolina I started finding out what the south was all about. Everyone that I saw was either smiling, helping others, or saying y'all. 
                                       It was if everyone was a robot programmed to say the right things and only have one emotion and thats kindness. We met our neighbors on day one of moving here. We didnt even have our furniture yet. 
                                       All we had was a blow up mattress and a small tv that contained a VHS player so we can watch some cool old school movies.
                                       The fact that I met friends to hang out with on the first night was incredibly awesome. If this is what Charlotte was going to be like, Im all for it.
                                       The games and fun we had in the neighborhood started as early as 6 am on occasion and lasted all the way until it got dark. Even then
                                       we would all eat dinner at each others homes. We played anything from basketball with the hoop lowered so we could dunk, manhunt basically a more intense 
                                       hide and seek, run around in the woods, and of course played video games however we stayed outside fairly often. Of course the fun didnt last long 
                                       because some of the families left in the neighborhood and life goes on at that point. Some friends still stuck around thank goodness and it was just about time
                                       to find a proper middle school for me. To be continued...
